## Hi, I'm Fyeqa Akram

I’m a Geospatial and environmental analyst specializing in geospatial analytics, remote sensing, and GIS, with a strong foundation in Python and R. My work focuses on transforming complex Earth Observation data into actionable insights to support environmental monitoring, biodiversity analysis, and climate resilience.

## Projects

### Forest Fire Susceptibility & Biodiversity Risk Assessment in Brandenburg

Master’s thesis project leveraging machine learning and explainable AI to assess forest fire susceptibility an impacts on biodiversity in Brandenburg, Germany.

- **Techniques:** Random Forest modeling, Leave-One-Year-Out (LOYO) validation, SHAP explainability  
- **Data:** Fire occurrence records (2016–2021), climate projections for 2030 & 2050, protected area datasets  
- **Key Findings:**  
  - Southern Brandenburg identified as a fire hotspot  
  - 24% of protected areas overlap with high-risk zones  
  - Proximity to railways, urban areas, and coniferous forests are major contributors  
- **Impact:** Proposed nature-based fire management and conservation strategies aligned with EU Biodiversity goals

### Park Accessibility in Berlin

This project analyzes the spatial distribution, accessibility, and equity of public parks across Berlin using geospatial data at two administrative levels:

- **District level** (Bezirk)
- **Sub-district level** (Ortsteil)

### Tree Detection and Segmentation

**TreeDetectR** is an R package designed to process LiDAR point cloud data for the detection and segmentation of individual trees in urban environments. It supports ground classification, canopy height modeling, tree top detection, tree segmentation, and exporting spatial tree coordinates.

- Libraries Used `lidR`, `terra`, `sf`, `raster`, and `RCSF` packages

### Oil Spill Detection Using SNAP

A GUI-based remote sensing project utilizing ESA’s **SNAP Toolbox** to detect and segment oil spills using **Sentinel-1 SAR** imagery. The workflow included subsetting, preprocessing (radiometric calibration, terrain correction, speckle filtering with Lee Sigma), polarization analysis (VV & VH), and SNAP’s built-in oil spill detection tool for identifying low-backscatter regions typical of oil slicks.

- Tools Used: `SNAP Toolbox`, `Sentinel-1 SAR`, `VV & VH Polarizations`, `Oil Spill Detection Tool`

### ContriBOT — Author Contribution Extraction (R Package)

Collaborated with the **BIH QUEST Center for Responsible Research** to develop **ContriBOT**, an R package for detecting and extracting Author Contribution statements, Acknowledgements, and ORCID mentions from scientific papers. Utilizes PDF-to-text conversion to classify author roles based on the CRediT taxonomy.

- Tools Used: `R`, `oddpub`, `furrr`, `progressr`
