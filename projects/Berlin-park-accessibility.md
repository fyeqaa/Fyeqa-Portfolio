#### Summary

This project investigates the distribution, accessibility, and equity of public parks across Berlin at both the district (*Bezirk*) and sub-district (*Ortsteil*) levels using geospatial data and 2024 population estimates. The analysis focuses on three main components:

- **Park Availability**: Counts the number of parks per administrative area.
- **Park Area per Capita**: Measures green space availability per resident to assess spatial equity.
- **Accessibility (800m Buffer)**: Evaluates the share of each area within an 800-meter walking distance to a park.

The study uses spatial joins, area calculations, and buffer analysis to identify disparities in park access across the city. Results are presented through interactive maps and a detailed summary report, providing actionable insights to support equitable urban planning in Berlin.


####  Key Findings

Districts like **Spandau** and **Marzahn-Hellersdorf** offer abundant park area per capita, densely populated areas such as **Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg** have limited green space. Nearly 38% of sub-districts lack any parks, revealing significant spatial disparities.These findings emphasize the need for targeted urban planning to promote equitable access to green spaces across Berlin.It highlights spatial inequalities in green space availability and park access. Interactive maps and detailed reports are included to support decision-making for equitable park development.
